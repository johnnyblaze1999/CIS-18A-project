## Project Description
This is a simple program that calculates, saves, and scans data from the user's input with the primary purpose of selling gift cards "securely." The program is simple and user friendly that only required your input as a single-digit number to navigate between options. The more exciting thing is that it prints out a receipt that records your purchases in a receipt looking way. Every data is stored as a text file, so I do not recommend you to change the value in those files because they're going to affect your on running program. One last note is that this program only works in the terminal, and it requires JDK-11 installed on the machine to operate.
## Instructions
Easy! Follow the terminal text, and press number buttons corresponded to which option you wanted to choose. The program only requires your name once, after that is all number inputs. Enjoy!
