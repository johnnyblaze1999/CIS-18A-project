## Project Description
This is a simple program that calculate, save, and scan datas from user's input with the main purpose of selling gift cards "securely". The program is simple and user friendly that only required your input as a single digit number to navigate between options. The more interesting thing is that it prints out a receipt which record your purchases in a receipt looking way. Every datas is stored as text file, so I do not recommend you to change the value in those files because they're going to affect your on running program. One last note is that this program only work in terminal, and it requires JDK-11 installed in order to operate.
